youre supposed build thing robust elegant slavishly attentive individual user like kind salesperson ironically part reason engineering traditionally averse handholding tradition date time engineer le powerfulwhen charge narrow domain building thing rather running whole show ornery youre scotty youre kirk another reason founder dont focus enough individual customer worry wont scale founder larval startup worry point current state nothing lose maybe go way make existing user super happy theyll one day many much would great problem see make happen incidentally youll find delighting customer scale better expected partly usually find way make anything scale would predicted partly delighting customer permeated culture never seen startup lured blind alley trying hard make initial user happy perhaps biggest thing preventing founder realizing attentive could user theyve never experienced attention standard customer service set company theyve customer mostly big one tim cook doesnt send handwritten note buy laptop cant thats one advantage small provide level service big company 6 realize existing convention upper bound user experience interesting pleasant way think far could go delight user experience trying think phrase convey extreme attention user realized steve job already done insanely great steve wasnt using insanely synonym meant literallythat one focus quality

early user permissible technique getting growth rolling successful startup necessary part feedback loop make product good making better mousetrap atomic operation even start way successful startup building something need first thing build never quite right except domain big penalty making mistake often better aim perfection initially software especially usually work best get something front user soon quantum utility see perfectionism often excuse procrastination case initial model user always inaccurate even youre one 7 feedback get engaging directly earliest user best ever get youre big resort focus group youll wish could go user home office watch use stuff like handful fire sometimes right unscalable trick focus deliberately narrow market like keeping fire contained first get really

well always worth asking there subset market get critical mass user quickly 8 startup use contained fire strategy unconsciously build something friend happen early adopter realize later could offer broader market strategy work well unconsciously biggest danger consciously aware pattern naively discard part eg dont build something friend even come corporate world friend early adopter youll longer perfect initial market handed platter among company best early adopter usually startup theyre open new thing nature started havent made choice yet plus succeed grow fast one many unforeseen advantage yc model specifically making yc big b2b startup instant market hundred startup ready hand meraki hardware startup there variant thing dont scale call pulling meraki although didnt fund meraki founder robert morris grad student know history got started something really doesnt scale assembling router hardware startup face obstacle software startup dont minimum order factory production run usually several hundred thousand dollar put catch22 without product cant generate growth need raise money manufacture product back hardware startup rely investor money pretty convincing overcome arrival crowdfunding precisely preorders helped lot even id advise startup pull meraki initially thats pebble pebble assembled first several hundred watch hadnt gone phase probably wouldnt sold 10 million worth watch go kickstarter like paying excessive attention early customer fabricating thing turn valuable hardware startup tweak design faster youre factory learn thing youd never known otherwise eric migicovsky pebble said one thing learned valuable source good screw knew consult sometimes advise founder b2b startup take overengagement extreme pick single user act consultant building something one user initial user serf form mold keep tweaking till fit need perfectly youll usually find youve made something user want even arent many probably adjacent territory long find one user really need something act need youve got toehold making something people want thats much startup need initially 9 consulting canonical example work doesnt scale like way bestowing one favor liberally safe long youre paid thats company cross line long youre product company thats merely extra attentive customer theyre grateful even dont solve problem start paying specifically attentivenesswhen start paying

rather recruiting one time even youre building really great getting user always gradual processpartly great thing usually also novel mainly user thing think partnership usually dont work dont work

ended getting practically nothing 11 enough something extraordinary initially make extraordinary effort initially strategy omits effortwhether expecting big launch get user big partneris ipso facto

overwhelmingly good experienceand main benefit treating startup vector remind founder need work hard two dimension 12 best case component vector contribute company dna unscalable thing get started

\u2013 sure simple definition network effect basically user use product service \u2019 valuable people using simple example facebook friend joined facebook powerful network became easier user connect friend exchange message see newsfeed see lot content shared user join facebook powerful even existing user base craig cannon 0152 \u2013 cool couple term thrown around space well virality growth could define well anu hariharan 0200 \u2013 yes take step back growth confused network effect \u2019 easy confuse two startup really valuable product provides inherent value \u2019 growing really fast happens common misconception think growth equal network different form growth \u2019 virality come picture think virality actually speed growth \u2019 value \u2019 difference could word mouth early day uber example people took ride pointtopoint arrived event would rave service user 10x better using taxi time became cheaper helped drive word mouth growth virality often free growth meaning unpaid growth drive without marketing product much superior alternate option available network effect hand value network offer term value example facebook would know whether network effect early day really usage word translates retention \u2019 different growth early day facebook even though growing quite fast would say reasonably fast compared apps today first web service retention improved meaning looked daily active monthly active early day added user percentage kept improving retention sign network effect existing user willing login frequently active service valuable craig cannon 0403 \u2013 okay gotcha \u2019 good example virality like app everyone know viral anu hariharan 0411 \u2013 think lot apps viral ask facebook \u2019 early day viral growth airbnb \u2019 much virality virality sense word mouth growth product \u2019 spread organic consequence use let define look facebook reason grew quite fast one user facebook useful right mean early day app launched see online student directory leveraged harvard directory launch facebook beyond \u2019 useful unless entire class group student taking class facebook therefore started inviting friend class product designed useful user skype wanted place skype call needed someone end product \u2019 spread result organic consequence use whereas airbnb think viral growth \u2019 word mouth growth look airbnb early day renting room house guest talked le sterile hotel especially event hotel sold 30 80 cheaper hotel talked friend therefore discovered actually use airbnb \u2019 need friend end use app think \u2019 difference different form growth need understand whether product organic consequence use tends grow really fast versus word mouth referral anything unpaid attribute viral growth craig cannon 0608 \u2013 point recommend founder mean people approaching asking like wan na build network effect product tell anu hariharan 0619 \u2013 think talk founder founder built really amazing product \u2019 think anyone would talk context network effect viral growth key decision took product help inform focused network keep coming repeatedly question founder always go back example facebook \u2019 also touch upon whatsapp example facebook first launched launched harvard quite popular service could easily rolled multiple university pretty quickly \u2019 actually took clustered approach reason wanted make sure ask early day would say wanted make sure least 80 harvard student using facebook maybe 60 70 using daily important think \u2019 focus engagement early day could end growing quickly lose older user base therefore \u2019 really focusing product improvement help overall network may end focusing feature help grow interim think one thing facebook really well always pay attention network grew user growth fact early day based number recorded s1 look month month growth user base 16 today \u2019 world mobile might say 16 month month growth solid great think \u2019 important focus driving inherent value existing code user grow \u2019 matter engagement case airbnb low velocity use case right people \u2019 travel often maybe twice year measure way measure booking rebookings cohort cohort airbnb measure customer really love come back use often use case think focusing early day especially build product \u2019 important focus grow strong engagement much existing user willing use service craig cannon 0902 \u2013 seeing people \u2019 effective anu hariharan 0906 \u2013 think day especially recent year would say consumer apps \u2019 become harder find distribution think two challenge consumer app think one entry point gon na launch thing two going distribute powerful network like facebook twitter snapchat becomes harder harder launch something feature platform network figure distribution strategy one app recently gained lot traction musically musically actually pivoted education app first launched tool among teen tool creating short form lip sync video tool provided made really easy teen create video fun thing cool people talked suddenly lot student school started using first 14 month even launched musically sort slow growth think founder alex talked almost run cash realized lot musically shared instagram twitter used tool sort shape towards community one thing tried make logo prominent shared instagram twitter people knew musically downloaded lot people created lip sync video clearly top user people lot fan base following really good creating lip sync video created qa sort platform app follower interact helped shift audience back app started focusing feature helped create community network app \u2019 still early say become network think thing \u2019 tried form community user going directly musically craig cannon 1126 \u2013 \u2019 getting started know time start trying pull people platform seems like piggyback platform certain extent point create lasting value company need people like community anu hariharan 1147 \u2013 absolutely network effect definition important people often say oh know people get confused like company product really network effect think two quick way really test barrier entry competitive model product barrier exit user think second one one people usually miss barrier entry mean growing really fast product provides inherent value demand side economy scale \u2019 easy someone come disrupt network overnight barrier exit user \u2019 built strong connection lot value network \u2019 easy switch user simple example facebook google google actually made really easy circle import contact graph even help break friend right people thousand friend facebook break closed circle versus circle probably touch base every hard user switch let alone company tried facebook user found hard switch connection communication \u2019 user newsfeed setup \u2019 lot thing lot value \u2019 already deriving platform absolutely hard user switch craig cannon 1329 \u2013 platform end winner take anu hariharan 1333 \u2013 business network effect winner take actually help tip towards becoming winner take business one focus sometimes investor look app destination app \u2019 sign barrier exit user user app directly spending lot time time spent user going \u2019 sign barrier accept user going well craig cannon 1406 \u2013 end happening uber lyft point \u2019 winner take anu hariharan 1409 \u2013 yes ride sharing always little bit controversial topic term network effect think one school thought silicon valley even broader ecosystem think strong network effect spectrum people think \u2019 strong network effect personal view break term product service offer sort moat company offer tend think basic pointtopoint right sharing service strong network effect simple reason \u2019 pointtopoint ride rider beyond taking point point b \u2019 value trapped another service equally good provides value willing switch barrier exit rider high mean \u2019 network effect \u2019 true think look city city basis form network effect think weak network effect meaning many driver rider platform rider promise eta le five minute know fact gon na get ride \u2019 gon na driver \u2019 gon na pick le five minute driver \u2019 dollar make per hour problem beyond five minute connection \u2019 another service provide something le five minute willing switch see people switching surge pricing every however said still winner take market think company economy scale supply set economy scale still monopolistic share \u2019 think playing ride sharing market two reason people use uber lyft 10 time better taxi cheaper taxi ride cheaper taxi ride think see economy scale driver platform rider platform cost unit output uber incurs probably much lower simply lot demand platform driver trip per hour therefore make dollar per hour therefore uber charge le per ride rider craig cannon 1655 \u2013 right \u2019 kind like race raise money seems like selfdriving car happen think \u2019 race reach selfdriving car unlocks network effect ultimately company \u2019 monopoly anu hariharan 1711 \u2013 \u2019 know need selfdriving monopoly honest think even current market dynamic seeing depending market supposed come \u2019 executed really well economy scale \u2019 allow monopolistic share simply trip efficiency key metric focus drive cost \u2019 seen lot uber x service sprung think uber might likely win uber x service simply drive delivery efficiency unlike one \u2019 able two three trip four trip hour cost per trip low \u2019 charge rider much pas saving rider exactly amazon first party new amazon launched service many year ago decade ago first party first party economy scale shared warehouse shared shipping made cost delivery good lot cheaper today big marketplace demand side supply side economy scale amazon first party primarily supply economy scale yet monopolistic share think people tend focus much sometimes network effect think \u2019 winner take business think company supply economy scale especially huge operational challenge execute really well monopolistic share craig cannon 1850 \u2013 market right think many people consider network effect reality \u2019 strong network effect anu hariharan 1900 \u2013 think demand biggest debate think \u2019 highly local \u2019 easy replicate across even nationally globally remains seen network evolve provide value \u2019 want discount \u2019 may strong saw social network craig cannon 1927 \u2013 messaging wanted talk whatsapp little see continuing grow u see larger international player coming network effect anu hariharan 1940 \u2013 think messaging strong network effect go back simple thing barrier exit user whatsapp user long lot family india cheapest form communication especially great replacement sm also think 2009 first launched launched status feature \u2019 know many reader know literally status feature let others know hey \u2019 gym \u2019 call \u2019 busy meeting \u2019 call \u2019 take still status feature think thing learned status feature really helped revolve towards messaging application meaning one first apps time used phone number address book use username today seems like \u2019 way go 2009 creating user account contrary approached sign process whatsapp quite lot thing user asked change user signup decided felt \u2019 leveraging address book would know person craig cannon 2105 \u2013 \u2019 something always wonder thing could considered growthhackey type thing amount marginal gain fact build really powerful network term adding product think lot people end creating thing never network effect consistently try add little thing anu hariharan 2130 \u2013 yeah think come back point pay attention engagement retention user \u2019 automatically know whether \u2019 network single strongest sign network effect think whatsapp pay attention paid lot attention even though \u2019 know exact metric used measure talk fact always focused core user continue use product drive value user fact \u2019 one reason moved status messaging think within six month almost end summer 2009 launched messaging saw huge spike growth alternate version sm started russian community san jose communicating family russia took international market end 2009 launched mm basically way share photo video expensive share photo video time became great platform share photo video app started growing user base existing user started using thing sm product feature went along driving value user \u2019 growing user base connection people able connect user strong network effect simply barrier exit user really high user communication family photo exchanged video \u2019 easy jump another messaging app craig cannon 2318 \u2013 see playing international messaging apps \u2019 massive dominate one country \u2019 play ultimately one eventually one international anu hariharan 2334 \u2013 think app strong network effect \u2019 difficult disrupt overnight another reason company tend focus building network \u2019 easy even \u2019 much would hard disrupt network overnight whatsapp strong foothold india wechat strong foothold china strong network people tend spend time value network think wil end seeing player rather one craig cannon 2412 \u2013 \u2019 founder building network question asking anu hariharan 2419 \u2013 first thing would say probably take step back say network marketplace platform think \u2019 important understand three super academic reason understand whether \u2019 three question ask really different depending network basically consider facebook network whatsapp network \u2019 group connected user \u2019 sharing information \u2019 trying drive product add value \u2019 trying increase value network grows marketplace two heterogeneous side two site think ebay marketplace seller buyer think airbnb host guest question would ask marketplace different would network platform third component user developer platform think group user developer help build platform programmatic customized group reinforces value craig cannon 2526 \u2013 \u2019 good example anu hariharan 2528 \u2013 microsoft operating system platform think wechat developing platform facebook platform interesting thing could three time see different company start important question ask depending start network think number one question ask entry strategy think entry strategy changing time facebook whatsapp clustered approach still think clustered approach work silicon valley outside silicon valley question debate entry strategy think grow reason yc even outside ecosystem people ask founder really focus growth product early sign network effect way build moat growing get critical mass growth second important thing third engagement trigger something facebook sort established early day new user platform could connect 10 friend within 14 day retention much higher think \u2019 important company \u2019 building network really focus trigger might may need time lot data understand paying attention trigger creates aha moment \u2019 important engagement always keep coming back engagement think \u2019 building network old existing user older cohort using else really pause ask \u2019 case fifth related entry strategy distribution platform people think market wide \u2019 huge market opportunity start cluster start kind topology could sort attack first sort measure productmarket fit expand question would asking building network example slack trying build network lot question grapple even growth stage distribution one team member gon na create aha moment getting team member slack \u2019 company like slack trying build network ought pay attention \u2019 marketplace question slightly different cause two side often heterogeneous even though \u2019 overlap host guest airbnb \u2019 lot question chicken egg problem scale one side much \u2019 fast side suffers experience platform suffers measure balance get critical mass kind marketplace actually might take longer realize network effect example airbnb took 36 month slow growth craig cannon 2845 \u2013 pause really quick probably first second common question marketplace get whole term question tip people creating marketplace get chicken egg problem anu hariharan 2902 \u2013 think ask successful marketplace marketplace scaled really well would almost always say focus demand first \u2019 various reason right strategy \u2019 give example instacart instacart first launched think launched like online grocery aggregator meaning could search tomato could search craig cannon 2932 \u2013 okay anu hariharan 2933 \u2013 within six month changed format retail store select whole food go launch simple reason lot customer ordering via instacart repeat order said \u201c hey really want know store \u2019 getting grocery \u201d really helped fuel growth focused demand side really understand value prop offering instacart \u2019 city city rollout took almost year little le year get playbook right san francisco sort rolled another city \u2019 mean take amount time hopefully \u2019 take amount time thing learned rolling san francisco helpful reach similar scale even halfway \u2019 much faster market test \u2019 trying rolling happens \u2019 launching new city need understand much demand may anticipate history understanding san francisco understanding chicago market staff amount supply standby meaning many shopper ask marketplace never get right always first time one thing know instacart used track early day lost delivery meaning delivery \u2019 fulfill people \u2019 complete order simply \u2019 time available \u2019 \u2019 shopper available always learn roll multiple market reason focus demand early go back everything teach yc focus whether customer love product really want product pain point \u2019 trying solve usually marketplace supply always go demand \u2019 enough demand \u2019 people sign supply side craig cannon 3142 \u2013 right people like make money guess wrap point people building platform question asking anu hariharan 3150 \u2013 think platform question similar two sided marketplace question side important example nintendo gaming console need lot third party game developer third party game developer come platform know user would playing game question little similar think important thing platform company also pay attention market think single platform winner would multiple strategy might little different depending \u2019 single multiple \u2019 cost involved thing demonstrating commitment platform example facebook acquired oculus showed enormous strong commitment oculus get gaming developer come oculus develop game vr think question similar marketplace show certain element strong commitment two community committing working platform \u2019 another element common among marketplace platform old saying money side subsidy side \u2019 know ever heard craig cannon 3314 \u2013 \u2019 know anu hariharan 3316 \u2013 \u2019 always one set user usually always \u2019 one set user price sensitive \u2019 one side price sensitive looking value simple example adobe early day rolled pdf document reader free charged document reader user base today would lot le document writer ready pay pdf creation tool wanted access reader try figure side sensitive side harder side try subsidize harder side know drive lot value money side craig cannon 3358 \u2013 \u2019 great point wrapping \u2019 spent ton time researching stuff person want learn would recommend resource like book like podcasts whatever link interview anu hariharan 3415 \u2013 think read deck put together andreessen horowitz lot great paper article think best way founder really learn look youtube video founder scaled amazing product early day try understand product philosophy decision motivated really help understand built network question focused think single important resource seen help inform thinking even \u2019 articulate academic term would see point ahead craig cannon 3502 \u2013 \u2019

hohpe published brilliant post starbucks use twophase commit read time working starbucks college year suddenly became relevant year gradually realized there even programmer learn popular coffee chain although many people may want build scalable software much harder first appears work individual task fall trap believing thing equally important need resource happen synchronously predefined order turn dontat least scalable system certainly starbucks make coffee preparing coffee starbucks fourstep process first customer stand line queue counter place order following firstinfirstserved rule second employee barista take order customer accepts payment third start preparing drink fourth ready place drink counter call customer name although may sound like reasonable model quickly lead long line impossible one person one thing time customer start queuing barista work order sequentially want serve customer need scale let look way scaling baristas one way starbucks scale hire super baristasvery talented fastworking bright people theyd need invest heavily development optimize every aspect work constantly improve efficiency software approach would called scaling vertical scaling problem scaling strategy there limit fast long one person work point even super barista wont able meet demand happens customer leave shop frustrated may come back similarly there limit far optimize software everything run sequentially cant buy 200ghz cpu even biggest cpu multicore core clocking 3\u20134ghz another way starbucks scale organize work way allows adding normal worker essence concurrent processing software one barista take order another start preparing first barista take another order first order prepared parallel might think best idea would consider concurrent processing demand reach certain level unfortunately simple there magical switch allow u turn concurrency need need prepare advance starbucks know new store open even one employee per shift everything needed concurrency place day one ready add people time lesson learned cant apply concurrent processing easily dont build system way support let look starbucks accomplishes start messaging youve ever ordered coffee starbucks might noticed little box cup filled symbol symbol sort shorthand used baristas quickly identify drink well extra eg whipped cream foam etc cup message essential communication employee signal barista beverage need created symbol written provide detail kind beverage prepare even coffee shop isnt busy there one person servicing customer front still add symbol cup first glance might seem like extra work large group customer suddenly enters shop employee back immediately jump help without need additional communication overhead start making drink based message lesson learned sudden spike arent problematic easily add worker anytime divide work among using message one way divide conquer described earlier whole coffee making process covered single employeea barista default setup starbucks one employee cashier taking order payment another barista making drink usually slowest part process preparing coffee multiple baristas prepare drink shop get busy often theyll take cup pile share work evenly example competing consumer pattern scenario however approach run trouble let say three baristas working one coffee machine one frappuccino machine three customer order coffee next one order frappuccino person taking order queue four cup appropriate symbol barista grab cup make coffee first one start making drink two blocked waiting coffee machine avoid contention resource dividing work one way separate message finegrained type handled differently example weve seen starbucks us cup message indicate drink need prepared system also differentiates hot cold drink hot drink served paper cup cold one plastic cup receive three order hot coffee followed one frappuccino three paper cup one plastic one two different pile first barista grab paper cup first pile start preparing drink second barista seeing coffee machine busy grab plastic cup second pile us frappuccino machine instead drink pile prepared parallel kind work division baristas divide task work parallel called partitioning lesson learned turn partitioning crucial element effective scaling strategy work need level scaling small task done fast done single worker multiple worker take care demanding slower task using partitioning scale activity independently work equally important one thing make starbucks successful theyve trained staff importance recognizing regular take guy come every morning get two venti americanos two grande latte bring team woman every wednesday order tall caramel macchiato stay shop hour read book barista notice tall caramel macchiato woman entering shop wednesday start preparing favorite drink even come counter customer get pleasant surprise never say want cashier already know usual drink ask shes take payment payment completed coffee already waiting counter might surprised high percentage starbucks customer regular giving best possible experience high priority quite often end getting drink faster customer make feel important encourages come back thus increasing value company lesson learned task important others organizing standard activity reusable independent building block easily modify process provide superior service valuable task need arises mistake worth preventing example starbucks employee needed verify customer paid receiving coffee make sure happens baristas could ask customer show receipt handing drink thats actually work starbucks discovered people try get coffee without paying analysis showed profitable keep baristas focused fulfilling order instead preventing occasional lost coffee someone happened take coffee ordered usually happens mistake barista would prepare new one question asked lesson learned build scalable system need embrace idea failure inevitable expensive try prevent completely instead focus making sure detect issue quickly compensate arise summary looked like simple fourstep process making coffee evolved interesting business process seemed exceptional rare first glance turned essential aspect business thing like sudden spike demand failure happen multiple time per day designing system handle well requires questioning common assumption often first model come mind wont address concern also many exceptional situation consider example cancelling order interesting problem example starbucks show followed na\u00efve approach business would able expand serve larger number customer service level would drop got customer point would stop coming instead need organize work way meet increasing demand end building system scale much rethinking business process technology information build scalable software check

online gallery didnt want online art business work spend 6 month working stupid idea didnt pay attention user invented model world didnt correspond reality worked didnt notice model wrong tried convince user pay wed built even took embarrassingly long catch attached model world id spent lot time software want many founder build thing one want begin trying think startup idea mo doubly dangerous doesnt merely yield good idea yield bad idea sound plausible enough fool working yc call madeup sitcom startup idea imagine one character tv show starting startup writer would invent something coming good startup idea hard something asking unless got amazingly lucky writer would come idea sounded plausible actually bad example social network pet owner doesnt sound obviously mistaken million people pet often care lot pet spend lot money surely many people would like site could talk pet owner perhaps 2 3 percent regular visitor could million user could serve targeted offer maybe charge premium feature 1 danger idea like run friend pet dont say would never use say yeah maybe could see using something like even startup launch sound plausible lot people dont want use least right could imagine people wanting sum reaction across entire population zero user 2 well startup launch least user really need theyre makingnot people could see using one day want urgently usually initial group user small simple reason something large number people urgently needed could built amount effort startup usually put version one would probably already exist mean compromise one

graph whose x axis represents people might want youre making whose axis represents much want invert scale axis envision company hole google immense crater hundred million people use need lot startup starting cant expect excavate much volume two choice shape hole start either dig hole thats broad shallow one thats narrow deep like well madeup startup idea usually first type lot people mildly interested social network pet owner nearly good startup idea second type microsoft well made altair basic couple thousand altair owner without software programming machine language thirty year later facebook shape first site exclusively harvard student thousand thousand user wanted lot idea startup ask want right want much theyll use even crappy version one made twoperson startup theyve never heard cant answer idea probably bad 3 dont need narrowness well per se depth need get narrowness byproduct optimizing depth speed almost always get practice link depth narrowness strong good sign know

easy make perfect paint naturally ive wondered passage since read high school im sure useful advice painting specifically fit situation well empirically way good startup idea become sort person

like publish life semipublicly internet theyd horrified idea mark already lived online seemed natural paul buchheit say people leading edge rapidly changing field live future combine pirsig get live

lot good idea also cause focus bad one thing missing take time see almost trick seeing idea around know idea one problem might answer impossibly unlikely exact moment technological progress stop sure people going build thing next year make think x problem get solved probably seem flamingly obvious retrospect need turn filter usually prevent seeing powerful simply taking current state world granted even radically openminded u mostly couldnt get bed front door stopped question everything youre looking startup idea sacrifice efficiency taking status quo granted start question thing inbox

one sign good idea ten minute searching web usually settle question even find someone else working thing youre probably late exceptionally rare startup killed competitorsso rare almost discount

\u201d say freedman \u201c building proactive reactive instrumentation help leapfrog unit test limitation believing component work tested input expected give got output expected get \u201d idea
